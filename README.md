PROBLEM STATEMENT:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The traditional methods for brain tumor diagnosis depends heavily on the human analysis of MRI scans, which presents several challenges. First, the process is slow, as it requires radiologists to carefully analyse each scan before making a decision. This delay can be critical for patients who require urgent medical attention. Second, accuracy depends on the expertise of the radiologist, and human factors such as tiredness or workload can result in errors. Misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis can negatively impact treatment outcomes. Third, the increasing volume of MRI scans being conducted daily makes it difficult for radiologists to keep up, leading to longer
waiting times and pressurized healthcare professionals.By implementing an AI-powered tumor detection system, these challenges can be effectively addressed. The system offers fast, automated, and highly accurate tumor detection, decreasing the need for human analysis by leveraging deep learning techniques, it ensures consistent
and reliable results, enabling medical professionals to make quicker and well-informed decisions. PROJECT OVERVIEW Detecting brain tumors early is very important because it helps doctors to treat patients more effectively. Usually, radiologists examine MRI scans manually, but this takes a lot of time and can sometimes lead to mistakes. To solve this problem, our project uses a deep learning model that automatically checks MRI images and tells whether a tumor is present or not. This model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), a type of artificial intelligence, to analyse the images with high accuracy. Since the system runs on a server, it can quickly process many MRI scans at once, making the diagnosis faster and reducing the workload for doctors. This helps improve the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor detection. 

SOLUTION OFFERED:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To overcome these challenges, this project introduces a server-based deep learning model that enhances tumor detection accuracy, feature extraction, and processing efficiency. Unlike previous models, it applies advanced CNN-based feature extraction, which helps in minimizing false positives and false negatives, ensuring more
reliable classification. The system is trained on a larger and more diverse dataset, making it adaptable to different MRI scans and reducing dataset bias.

TECHNOLOGY USED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM\
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Artificial Intelligence (AI)

Expert Systems: These are rule-based systems that simulate the decision-making ability of a
human expert. They use knowledge bases and inference rules to make decisions. 

2. Machine learning (ML)

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs are deep learning models that excel at image
recognition by automatically learning features from raw images. 

3.Deep Learning (DL)

DL involves more complex models like CNNs, which automatically learn hierarchies of
features from large datasets.

4.Support Vector Machines (SVM)

SVM is a supervised learning algorithm that creates a decision boundary to classify data into
distinct categories.
